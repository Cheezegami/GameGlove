# Guide
NOTE: Make sure to only use the rightmost 5 cm of your breadboard so that the other components such as the arduino, band and 9v battery are able to rest on the rest of the breadboard, if you're unsure, place the 3 components on the breadboard 

1.- make sure you have a wire connected to the red strip on the breadboard reading +, these are for energizing your components and will be used later in the tutorial.
So connect a male jumper wire from the 5v on the arduino to the plus sign on the breadboard.
Also connect a male jumper wire from the ground on the arduino to the minus sign on the breadboard.

2.- Make sure the led matrix is soldered and connect it to the assigned ports on the Arduino.

(+) - Connect the plus (leftmost fit) to the plus strip on the breadboard)

(-) - Connect the minus (next to it) to the minus strip on the breadboard)

(D) - Connect the d (second to the right) to the Analogue 4 on the Arduino)

(C) - Connect the c (most right) to the Analogue 5 on the Arduino)


3.- Connect the buzzer
Make sure the buzzer is connected to the digital pin 9 (customizable in code) and the ground with an optional resistor.

4.-

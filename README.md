1x 9v Battery Snap Connector.
1x (Full sized) Breadboard
1x Arduino Uno 
1x Buzzer
1x Led Matrix
1x Thumbstick

5x female to male jumper wires (To connect Thumbstick)
11x male to male jumper wires(not including 9v connector)


Other:
1 Roll of strong double sided tape.
1 Winter Glove with a Velcro 

# Guide
NOTE: Make sure to only use the rightmost 5 cm of your breadboard so that the other components such as the arduino, band and 9v battery are able to rest on the rest of the breadboard, if you're unsure, place the 3 components on the breadboard 
1.- make sure you have a wire connected to the red strip on the breadboard reading +, these are for energizing your components and will be used later in the tutorial.
So connect a male jumper wire from the 5v on the arduino to the plus sign on the breadboard.
Also connect a male jumper wire from the ground on the arduino to the minus sign on the breadboard.
1.- Make sure the led matrix is soldered and connect it to the assigned ports on the Arduino.
(+) - Connect the plus (leftmost fit) to the plus strip on the breadboard)
(-) - Connect the minus (next to it) to the minus strip on the breadboard)
(D) - Connect the d (second to the right) to the Analogue 4 on the Arduino)
(C) - Connect the c (most right) to the Analogue 5 on the Arduino)

2.- Connect the buzzer
Make sure the buzzer is connected to the digital pin 9 (customizable in code) and the ground with an optional resistor.

3.-
